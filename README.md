# asynchronous-server-tasks
A wrapper to implement asynchronous server taks in your PHP project


remember to run first ```composer dumpautoload``` in order to generate the appropriate autoload files


To run the example:

create a virtual a host with "your-local-name" in your development environment:

now, go to your browser and write http://your-local-name and you'll see a simple page with a button to start a new task
and an area to see messages.
